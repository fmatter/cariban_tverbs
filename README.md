# \*t-adding verbs in Cariban languages

This is a study of a group of verbs in Cariban languages which take an idiosyncratic third-person marker reconstructible as Proto-Cariban \**t-*.
It is also a test run for the CLDF markdown implementation in [cldfviz](https://github.com/cldf/cldfviz).
The following languages are featured in the study, although the descriptive coverage varies strongly:
