# \*t-adding verbs in Cariban languages

This is a study of a group of verbs in Cariban languages which take an idiosyncratic third-person marker reconstructible as [lg](LanguageTable#cldf:PC) \**t-*.
It is also a test run for the CLDF markdown implementation in [cldfviz](https://github.com/cldf/cldfviz).
The following languages are featured in the study, although the descriptive coverage varies strongly:

[lg](LanguageTable#cldf:__all__)

([](cldf/sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link=references#cldf:waiwaihawkins1998): 132f.)

[form](FormTable?with_language#cldf:6)
